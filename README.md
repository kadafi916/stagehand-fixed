# Stagehand

**Requires an [Easynews](https://easynews.com) account. Generic NNTP is not supported yet.**

Stagehand is a TV series manager that automatically downloads new episodes and provides a web UI for managing your collection.

---

## Features

- Dark single-page web UI — no page reloads, hash-based routing
- Multiple metadata providers per series (TheTVDB and TVmaze)
- Easynews HTTP global search (enabled by default)
- Per-episode and per-season status management
- Live log streaming in the browser
- Full settings UI — no config file editing required for common options
- Python 3.11+ (Docker image uses Python 3.13)

---

## Quick start

```bash
docker build -t stagehand .

docker run -d -p 8088:8088 \
  -v $HOME/.config/stagehand:/root/.config/stagehand \
  -v /path/to/tv:/tv \
  stagehand
```

Open **http://localhost:8088** in your browser.

---

## Configuration

On first run Stagehand creates `~/.config/stagehand/config` (mapped from the host path above). Most settings are now configurable through the **Settings** page in the UI. The config file is watched for changes and picked up without a restart.

### Easynews credentials

Enter your username and password in **Configure → Settings → Easynews**. Easynews is enabled automatically once credentials are saved.

Alternatively, add them directly to the config file:

```
searchers.easynews.username = your_username
searchers.easynews.password = your_password
```
